          <h3>Eco-Evo-Devo of Annual Killifishes</h3>
          <p>
            Killifishes are emerging research models for evolution, development, behavior, cancer, developmental 
            perturbations, and aging. This is because annual killifishes have dormant (diapausing) embryos that 
            withstand seasonal habitat desiccation which results in death of the entire parental 
            population. This annual life history includes the independent, convergent evolution of rapid aging 
            and embryonic dormancy among distantly related lineages of killifishes. We are using annual killifishes 
            and their relatives as a model clade to explore the evolution of developmental phenotypes in extreme 
            environments. We study how killifish embryos enter and exit diapause, a suspended state of development 
            that enables survival through harsh environmental conditions. Using annual and non-annual killifishes, 
            we explore how environmental gradients shape development, life history, and phenotypic plasticity.

          <h3>Developmental Genomics of Ancient Fishes</h3>
          <p>
            Most fishes, like killifishes, are decendents from a common ancestor that underwent whole genome duplication.  
            Consequently, they possess highly diverged paralogous genes that have sub- or neo functionalized. However, 
            some slowly evolving "Living Fossil" fishes diverged before this genome duplication. By using living fossils 
            like Bowfin (Amia calva), Spotted Gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), and lampreys, we are studying the deep homology of vertebrate 
            developmental phenotypes and the evolutionary consequences of gene and genome duplication. Importantly, the 
            slowly evolving gar and bowfin genomes can be used as stepping stones to find homologous genetic elements between 
            humans and rapidly evolving biomedical fish models like killifishes. We have published the Bowfin genome 
            in Nature Genetics. We used Bowfin to identify the gene regulatory elements responsible for numerous 
            vertebrate developmental phenotypes. Bowfin solidifies our stepping stone comparative approach into a 
            "Holostean Bridge" using all major living holostean fish lineages (gars and bowfins) to bridge the gap between 
            humans and other fishes.
